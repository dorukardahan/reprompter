## Scenario 1: Quick Mode - Simple Input

**Input:** "add a loading spinner"
**Expected:** Quick Mode activates, generates prompt immediately without interview.
**Verify:** No AskUserQuestion call, output includes `<role>`, `<task>`, `<requirements>`.

## Scenario 2: Quick Mode - Complex Rejection

**Input:** "update dashboard tracking and configure alerts"
**Expected:** Quick Mode is REJECTED (compound task + integration/state signals: "and", "tracking", "configure", "alerts").
**Verify:** Full interview runs. AskUserQuestion is called with at least task type + execution mode.

## Scenario 3: Full Interview Flow

**Input:** "we need some kind of authentication thing, maybe oauth"
**Expected:** Full interview with AskUserQuestion. All required high-priority questions asked (lower-priority questions may be dropped when replaced by task-specific mandatory questions).
**Verify:**
- Task Type question appears
- Execution Mode question appears
- Motivation question appears
- Generated prompt includes all XML sections
- Quality score is shown (before/after)

## Scenario 4: Team Mode

**Input:** "build a real-time chat system with websockets, database, and React frontend"
**Expected:** Team mode detected or offered. Team brief generated with 2-5 agent roles.
**Verify:**
- Execution Mode question offers team options
- If team selected: team brief is generated at `/tmp/rpt-brief-*.md`
- Per-agent sub-prompts are generated (one per agent)
- Each sub-prompt is scoped to that agent's responsibility

## Scenario 5: Context Detection

**Setup:** Run from a directory with `package.json` (Next.js), `tsconfig.json`, `prisma/schema.prisma`.
**Input:** "add user profile page"
**Expected:** Auto-detects tech stack and includes in context.
**Verify:**
- Context mentions Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma
- Source transparency: "Auto-detected from: [pwd]"
- No parent directory scanning

## Scenario 6: No Project Fallback

**Setup:** Run from home directory (`~`) or empty directory.

**Verify:**
- Message: "No project context detected"
- No framework assumptions in generated prompt

## Scenario 7: Opt-Out

**Setup:** Run from a project directory with config files.
**Input:** "reprompt no context - add a button"

**Verify:**
- No tech stack in context
- Generic prompt generated
- Opt-out keyword detected ("no context")

## Scenario 8: Closed-Loop Quality (v6.0+)

**Input:** "reprompter run with quality - audit the auth module"
**Expected:** Full loop: improve prompt -> execute -> evaluate -> retry if needed.
**Verify:**
- Prompt is generated and scored
- Execution happens (single agent or team)
- Output is evaluated against success criteria
- If Repromptverse score < 8, retry with delta prompt (Single mode threshold remains < 7 for prompt quality)
- Max 2 retries observed

## Scenario 9: Edge Cases

### 9a: Empty Input
**Input:** "" (empty)
**Expected:** Ask user to provide a prompt. Do not generate.

### 9b: Non-English Input
**Input:** "ajouter un bouton de connexion" (French)
**Expected:** Detect language, generate prompt in French.

### 9c: Code Block Input
**Input:** "fix this: ```js\nconst x = undefined.foo\n```"
**Expected:** Treat code as context, extract intent ("fix undefined access"), generate debugging prompt.

### 9d: Very Long Input (500+ words)
**Input:** [paste a 600-word requirements document]
**Expected:** Summarize key points, confirm with user, flag as complex, run full interview.

### 9e: Conflicting Choices
**Scenario:** User selects "Fix Bug" as task type but "Team (Parallel)" as execution mode.
**Expected:** Ask clarifying follow-up: "You chose Bug Fix but also Team Parallel - is this a multi-service bug?"

**Verify:** Table includes score, finding count, key insight per agent. Total row shows aggregate stats.

## Scenario 38: Interview Context Flows Into Agent Constraints

**Input:** "repromptverse - audit katman" then answer interview with "frontend out of scope" and "min 10 findings"
**Expected:** Every agent's `<constraints>` includes "Frontend out of scope". Every agent's `<success_criteria>` includes "minimum 10 findings".
**Verify:**
- Read agent prompts from `/tmp/rpt-agent-prompts-*.md`, confirm interview context is embedded
- Plan Cards table distinguishes interview-sourced vs auto-detected constraints

## Scenario 39: Dimension Interview - Maximum Questions (All Dimensions Low)

**Input:** "repromptverse - do stuff to the thing"
**Expected:** All 4 askable dimensions (Clarity, Specificity, Constraints, Decomposition) score < 5. Exactly 4 questions asked in priority order (lowest score first). Structure is NOT asked about.
**Verify:** 4 AskUserQuestion calls, no Structure question, priority ordering matches score ranking.

## Scenario 40: Status Line Rendered During Polling

**Input:** Any Repromptverse task during Phase 3 execution.
**Expected:** Each poll cycle shows compact status line with emoji indicators.
**Verify:** Status line format matches `Agents: ✅ N/T ⏳ N/T 🔄 N/T` pattern. Retry agents show retry count.

## Scenario 41: Interview Dismissed - Graceful Fallback

**Input:** "repromptverse - audit the system" then skip/dismiss all interview questions.
**Expected:** Proceed with empty interviewContext. Plan Cards show "Interview: skipped by user".
**Verify:** No interviewContext applied to agent prompts. Team plan uses auto-detected context only.

## Anti-Patterns (Should NOT Happen)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|-------------|----------------|
| Stop after interview without generating | Step 4 (generation) is required |
| Quick Mode on compound prompts | Complexity keywords should force interview |
| Cross-project context leakage | Session isolation must be enforced |
| Generate in English for non-English input | Should match input language |
| Skip task-specific questions for complex prompts | Domain-specific questions are mandatory |
| Launch agents without showing Plan Cards | User must see agent plan before $2-4 execution |
| Write synthesis without Result Cards | Result summary is mandatory before synthesis |
| Ask Structure questions in Dimension Interview | Structure is auto-fixed, never asked |
| Show Dimension Interview for high-score prompts | All askable dimensions >= 5 means skip |
