RePrompter is a prompt engineering skill for AI coding agents. It takes rough, low-quality prompts and transforms them into structured, high-scoring prompts that produce dramatically better results. Works with Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, or any LLM that accepts structured prompts.

## Three Modes

| Mode | What it does | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Single** | Interview, structure, score one prompt | `reprompt this`, `clean up this prompt` |
| **Repromptverse** | Plan a team of 2-5 agents, reprompt each one, execute in parallel, evaluate, retry | `reprompter teams`, `repromptverse`, `smart run` |
| **Reverse** | Show a great output, extract the prompt DNA that produced it | `reverse reprompt`, `learn from this`, `prompt dna` |

## Before / After

```
Input:  "uhh build a crypto dashboard, maybe coingecko data, add caching, test it too"
Score:  1.6/10
```

```xml
Output: Structured XML prompt with role, context, task, requirements,
        constraints, output format, and success criteria
Score:  9.0/10  (+462%)
```

<details>

```xml
<role>
Senior full-stack engineer specializing in real-time dashboard systems,
REST API integration, and cache-aware data pipelines.
</role>

<context>
- Frontend + backend + tests required (cross-layer scope)
- Data source: CoinGecko API (free tier, 30 calls/min rate limit)
- Existing API behavior must be preserved
</context>

<task>
Deliver a real-time crypto dashboard backed by a cache-aware CoinGecko proxy API,
with unit tests for both API and UI, without breaking existing API contracts.
</task>

<requirements>
- Build dashboard UI with loading, error, empty, and stale-data states
- Implement backend CoinGecko proxy with JSON schema validation + configurable cache TTL
- Preserve backward compatibility for all existing API consumers
- Add deterministic unit tests for frontend rendering states and backend edge cases
- Cache must serve stale data on upstream failure (stale-while-revalidate pattern)
</requirements>

<constraints>
- No direct client-side calls to CoinGecko (all traffic through proxy)
- No breaking changes to existing API response fields or status codes
- Mock all external network boundaries in tests
- Rate limit CoinGecko calls to stay within free tier (30/min)
</constraints>

<output_format>
- Backend: /api/prices endpoint returning { prices: [...], cached: bool, updatedAt: ISO }
- Frontend: React component with 5s auto-refresh interval
- Tests: Vitest suite with >=80% branch coverage
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Dashboard auto-updates every 5s and shows "stale" indicator when cache is old
- Proxy returns normalized data within 200ms (cache hit) / 2s (cache miss)
- Existing API integration tests still pass with zero modifications
</success_criteria>
```

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
mkdir -p skills/reprompter
curl -sL https://github.com/aytuncyildizli/reprompter/archive/main.tar.gz | \
  tar xz --strip-components=1 -C skills/reprompter
```

### OpenClaw / Codex

```bash
cp -R reprompter /path/to/workspace/skills/reprompter
```

### Any LLM

Use `SKILL.md` as the behavior spec. Templates are in `references/`.

---

## Quick Start

```
reprompt this: build a REST API with auth and rate limiting
```

```
reprompter teams - audit the auth module for security and test coverage
```

```
reverse reprompt this: [paste a great output you want to reproduce]
```

RePrompter interviews you (2-5 questions), generates a structured XML prompt, and shows a before/after quality score.

---

## How It Works

### Single Mode

```
Rough prompt → Input guard → Quick mode gate → Interview (2-5 questions)
→ Template selection → XML prompt generation → Quality scoring → Delta rewrite if < 7/10
```

17 templates cover feature, bugfix, refactor, testing, API, UI, security, docs, content, research, and multi-agent swarm patterns.

### Repromptverse Mode

```
Phase 1: Score prompt, interview if needed, plan team, show Plan Cards → user approves
Phase 2: Write XML prompt per agent (target 8+/10), show quality scorecard
Phase 3: Execute (tmux / TeamCreate / OpenClaw / sequential fallback)
Phase 4: Show Result Cards, evaluate, retry with delta prompts if needed (max 2)
```

Agents get non-overlapping scopes, explicit success criteria, and file:line reference requirements. The evaluator loop ensures quality before synthesis.

### Reverse Mode

```
Exemplar output → EXTRACT structure → ANALYZE task type + domain + tone
→ SYNTHESIZE XML prompt → Score → Optional: INJECT into flywheel
```

11 task type classifiers (code review, security audit, architecture doc, API spec, test plan, bug report, PR description, documentation, content, research, ops report) with 8 domain detectors and tone analysis. Solves the flywheel cold-start problem by seeding it with known-good prompt/output pairs.

## Key Features

**Closed-Loop Flywheel (v12)** - The loop is now end-to-end. Every prompt emits a `<success_criteria>` block of testable assertions. After execution, `scripts/outcome-record.js` writes a structured record joining prompt + criteria + output; `scripts/evaluate-outcome.js` scores it against the criteria (regex / predicate / llm_judge / manual). Records feed into a local flywheel via `npm run flywheel:ingest`. At generation time, `REPROMPTER_FLYWHEEL_BIAS=1` makes the skill consult past outcomes and bias toward historically winning recipes. `npm run flywheel:ab` compares bias-on vs bias-off effectiveness so you can *prove* whether the bias is helping. All data local.

**Prompt Flywheel Recipe Fingerprinting** - Every prompt carries a deterministic recipe fingerprint (template + patterns + capability tier + domain + context layers + quality bucket). Strategy learner groups outcomes by fingerprint so recommendations are grounded in repeated evidence, not one-off runs.

**Agent Cards** - Plan Cards (before execution), Status Line (during), Result Cards (after). Full transparency into what agents will do, are doing, and found.

**Dimension Interview** - Low-scoring prompt dimensions trigger targeted questions. No more vague prompts spawning expensive agents.

**Pattern Library** - 6 pluggable prompt engineering patterns: constraint-first framing, uncertainty labeling, self-critique checkpoints, delta retry scaffolds, evidence-strength labeling, context-manifest transparency.

**Capability Routing** - When multiple models are available, routes each agent by capability tier (reasoning, long context, cost-optimized, latency-optimized) with provider-diverse fallback chains.
